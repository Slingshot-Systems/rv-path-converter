    <h2>RV Path Converter</h2>
    <p>This is a simple package that allows you to change the path of incoming source media, e.g. to remap the path for your platform.</p>
    <p>It provides a graphical interface instead of relying on environment variables.</p>
    <p>Note that this package only modifies paths loaded via session files or URLs, 
    it does not affect files manually added by drag & drop or from the command line.<p>
